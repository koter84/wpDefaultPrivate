WordPress plugin to make posts private by default

== Description ==

wpDefaultPrivate makes all your posts private when you publish them.

At first the changes are only in the front-end and are not saved to the database, this way you can still use statuses like draft, pending and future.
When the status of a post changes to published it is instead changed to private. After the initial "publish" you can change the post-status to public if you would like some posts to be public.

bugs and feature-requests can go to: [GitHub](https://github.com/koter84/wpDefaultPrivate/issues) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wpdefaultprivate)
